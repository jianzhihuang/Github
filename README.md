## Purpose of the `stale.yml` Workflow

The purpose of the `stale.yml` workflow is to generate random commit messages and push them to the repository at regular intervals. This workflow is scheduled to run every hour and performs the following steps:

* Checks out the repository using the `actions/checkout@v4` action.
* Introduces a random delay between 0 to 60 seconds.
* Generates two random commit messages using predefined types, scopes, actions, and issues.
* Configures the Git user email and name using secrets.
* Pulls the latest changes from the repository.
* Commits and pushes five empty commits with random messages, each followed by a random sleep between 30 to 60 seconds.
* Optionally creates a release if specified in the workflow inputs.

The workflow is defined in the file `.github/workflows/stale.yml` located in the `.github/workflows` directory.
